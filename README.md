JokeMe is a mini project of Jordan DeLoach (@jtmcgee). 
Be cool, fork it, push it, make it better.

To download the standalone, just download https://github.com/jdeloach/Jokeme/blob/master/bin/jokeme. It runs on Linux, probably Mac.
Windows people, just use the jar in the bin. Someone want to write a cool batch script or exe?

How To Use
==================
Working it isn't very complex. Just run 'jokeme' or 'jokeme CATEGORYnameHERE'. 
You can see possible joke categories by typing 'jokeme categories'
